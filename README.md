**Technologies Used - HTML, CSS, REACT.JS, NODE.JS, TYPESCRIPT**
Objective:

Build a real-time chat application with the following features:

Universal Chat Room: A single chat room accessible to any authenticated user.
Authentication: Implement a login system to ensure that only authenticated users can access the chat room.
Demo Credentials: Provide demo credentials for easy testing without the need to sign up.
Requirements:

Frontend:

Create a simple, user-friendly interface using React
Implement a login page where users can enter credentials to access the chat room.
Display the chat room with real-time message updates.
Include a message input field and a send button for users to post messages.
Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Backend:

Develop the backend using Node.js and Express (or any other modern backend framework you prefer).
Set up a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to manage user credentials and store chat messages.
Implement WebSocket functionality to handle real-time messaging.
Create endpoints for user authentication and fetching/posting chat messages.
Provide demo credentials in the backend for testing purposes (e.g., username: demo, password: password).
Real-time Communication:

Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io) to enable real-time communication in the chat room.
Ensure that messages sent by users are instantly visible to all users in the chat room.

Security:

Protect the chat room behind a login wall.
Sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
Implement basic error handling and display appropriate error messages to user
